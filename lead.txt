Ade, gw lg maw buat project baru nih
A sass based CRM gitu

I am currently looking for help in the web dev as well potentially android gt
Are you open for a freelancing project/career switch?

Ini gw n partner gw bru maw mulai ini startup
Jadi stageny msh very early
We are in the process of building the MVP, then targeting to raise fund in a month or two
Ntar we'll find office after we raise fund gt
Jadi probably will work remotely in a month or two

jadi mungkin jg we can do freelancing together first, then after we raise fund we can discuss about converting


Management bakal used the web to see dashboard, report sgala gitu
Untuk salesny, mereka kan perlu data entry yang gampang, jadi we'll develop an android app that focus on the sales team gt

Nah salesny kan most likely need to do data entry, nah android appn

We are wondering if you might be interested
